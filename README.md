Sphero ROS demos
=============
Some very basic demos using the Sphero ROS node - let's do some full RGB light painting next!

New to ROS??? Learn more here: [http://www.ros.org/](http://www.ros.org/)

examples:
```bash
$ rosrun sphero_demos sphero_colors_demo
$ rosrun sphero_demos sphero_collision_demo
$ rosrun sphero_demos sphero_xbox_demo
```

NOTES: 
* All of the examples require the Sphero ROS node found here: [http://mmwise.github.io/sphero_ros/](http://mmwise.github.io/sphero_ros/)
* The xbox demo requires the roadnarrows peripherals package (specifically the xbox controller node)... you could do the work to swap it out for a key board, or other controller.

Enjoy!
